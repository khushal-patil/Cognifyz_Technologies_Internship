Machine Learning Internship - Cognifyz Technologies

About This Internship

This internship at Cognifyz Technologies provides an opportunity to work on real-world machine learning projects. It is designed to help me gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation techniques. I will complete three out of four tasks outlined below, with the potential to earn a stipend upon successful completion.

Task List

1. Predict Restaurant Ratings

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on its features.
Steps:

Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, split data).

Select and train a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression).

Evaluate the model using regression metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Analyze influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

2. Restaurant Recommendation System

Objective: Create a recommendation system based on user preferences.
Steps:

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Determine criteria for recommendations (e.g., cuisine type, price range).

Implement a content-based filtering approach.

Test the system with sample user preferences and evaluate recommendation quality.

3. Cuisine Classification

Objective: Build a classification model to categorize restaurants based on their cuisines.
Steps:

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Analyze model performance across different cuisines.

4. Location-based Analysis

Objective: Conduct a geographical analysis of restaurant locations.
Steps:

Visualize restaurant distribution using latitude and longitude data.

Group restaurants by city/locality and analyze density.

Compute statistics on ratings, cuisines, and price ranges by location.

Identify trends and patterns in restaurant distribution.

This internship was a great opportunity to enhance my skills in machine learning and data analysis while working on meaningful projects. I successfully completed the tasks and gained valuable insights, which I look forward to applying in future endeavors!
